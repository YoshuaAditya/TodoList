# TodoList
Adding this information because I forgot to explain my approach in the email.

Firstly, I have some experience using Room database, so my first step is creating the Room database from previous project and then renaming the variables into todos.
Next step is creating the UI layout for the tasks list and create/edit task. For the UI, I just follow a simple layout of most to do lists. While creating the UI I also implement Create Task functionality.
Then, after adding so much dummy data, I decided to implement Delete Task to clean up some tasks. Finally, I implement the Edit Task as the last.
While the main features are done, I realized that when checking the tasks, the checked status will get reset when the app closes. I decided to add checkbox values into the database as the last implementation.

For the coding part, I mostly read Google documentation or search at StackOverflow to implement stuff that I haven't done in the past.
